</h1>

Modular browser extension for Twitch that combines several quality-of-life improvements in one place. Designed as a unified replacement for multiple separate Twitch userscripts, it offers shared settings, per-module toggles, and separate builds for **Chrome/Chromium** and **Firefox**.

It currently includes [**Toggle Video Quality**](https://github.com/Vikindor/twitch-toggle-video-quality), [**Force Sort Viewers High to Low**](https://github.com/Vikindor/twitch-force-sort-viewers), [**Show Stream Language**](https://github.com/Vikindor/twitch-show-stream-language), [**Keep Tab Active**](https://github.com/Vikindor/twitch-keep-tab-active), and the new **Auto Claim Channel Points** feature.

Especially useful for people who like to **keep streams running in the background** to support streamers, farm **channel points**, or keep streams running for **Drops** with less manual babysitting.

> ⚠️ This extension does not block ads and does not attempt to bypass Twitch ad delivery

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- This extension does not block ads and does not attempt to bypass Twitch ad delivery.
- The extension action button currently triggers `Toggle Video Quality` specifically.
- `Keep Tab Active` may behave differently across browsers or Twitch updates.
- Browser throttling with a large number of open tabs is controlled by the browser itself, and the extension cannot override it.
- If you run into throttling-related playback issues, using tab mute is generally more reliable than muting the Twitch player directly.
